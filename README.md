## Challenges 
This assignment as a whole was a challenge for me. For the week of this assignment's content, we had substitutes and I had overtime at work. Their lectures were a bit hard for me to follow and coupling that with working loads made for a difficult time comprehending the material. I thought I knew what I was doing when I first got to it but after plugging away for a while I decided I'd need help.
<br/><br/>
After some talk with a tutor I realized how far off I was. I had a general idea of the files, file structure and the syntax necessary for the requirements to be fulfilled. It was just a matter of where do I put things and what am I missing. The session with the tutor provided a chance to be challenged and refreshed on the material. A couple of notes/gems shared by the tutor were added throughout the project via notes. 
<br/><br/>
The mini project from week 11 provided a lot of inspiration for this assignment. Some of the necessary syntax matched that of which was in the week 11 mini project - so I copied the snippets and edited them to befit this assignment. That is mentioned in the given area of the assignment. 

## Usage 
This application is intended for those who need a simple note generator. Simply clone the project onto your local device by running /git clone git@github.com:shyanrafer/note-generator.git/ after navigating to your desired file location in your CLI. From there, assuming you've the proper plug-ins installed, run /code ./ to open the file in your given code writing interface. Navigate to the package.json file, open in integrated terminal, then run /npm i/ to install all of the given npm packs. After packs have been installed, close that terminal session and then open one on the server.js file. Once done, run /node server/ and then click the link to the local host session and begin using the application.
